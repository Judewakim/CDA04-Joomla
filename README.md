# CDA04 WordPress Deployment

> **A comprehensive guide to deploying WordPress using AWS services.**

## üìñ Overview

This repository provides resources and scripts to deploy a WordPress website using AWS services. The deployment architecture includes:

- **Amazon EC2**: Hosts the WordPress application.
- **Amazon RDS**: Manages the MySQL database for WordPress.
- **AWS CloudFormation**: Automates the infrastructure deployment.
- **User Data Scripts**: Automates the configuration of the WordPress installation.

## üöÄ Features

- **Automated Deployment**: Utilize CloudFormation templates for consistent and repeatable infrastructure setup.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Leverage AWS services to ensure the WordPress site can handle varying traffic loads.
- **Secure Configuration**: Implement best practices for security, including network isolation and managed database services.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before deploying this solution, ensure you have:

- ‚úÖ An **AWS Account** with necessary permissions to create resources.
- ‚úÖ **AWS CLI** installed and configured on your local machine.
- ‚úÖ **WordPress** installation package ready for deployment.

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Judewakim/CDA04-Wordpress.git
cd CDA04-Wordpress
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Review CloudFormation Template**

- Open the `cda04-twotierarch-code.yml` file.
- Ensure the configurations align with your requirements, such as instance types, database settings, and network configurations.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Deploy the CloudFormation Stack**

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name WordPressStack --template-body file://cda04-twotierarch-code.yml --parameters ParameterKey=KeyName,ParameterValue=YourKeyName
```

Replace `YourKeyName` with the name of your EC2 Key Pair.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Configure WordPress**

After the stack creation:

1. Retrieve the public DNS of the EC2 instance from the AWS Management Console.
2. SSH into the instance and verify that `user-data.sh` has correctly installed WordPress.
3. Ensure `configure_wp_config.sh` has configured the `wp-config.php` file with the correct database details.
4. Access the WordPress setup wizard by navigating to `http://<EC2-Public-DNS>/wordpress` in your browser.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the WordPress installation.

## üóë Cleanup

To remove all deployed resources:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name WordPressStack
```

Ensure all associated resources, such as S3 buckets or additional security groups, are deleted to prevent unnecessary charges.
